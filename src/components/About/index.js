  <h3>About Me</h3>
  <p>
    This will be the about me section where I get very uncomfortable because
    I hate describing myself. I have no idea what to write here. I love my
    life, but I feel others would be bored reading about it. I love my
    partner and my pets and my days are consumed by caring for them and this
    new venture Iâ€™m on to learn something I will hopefully be good at and
    find financial independence.
